# How to use

## 1 Step flow

To use the `OpenPassport1StepVerifier`, import and initialize it as follows:

```typescript
import { OpenPassport1StepVerifier } from '@openpassport/sdk';
const verifier = new OpenPassport1StepVerifier({
  scope: 'yourScope',
  requirements: [
    ['older_than', '18'],
    ['nationality', 'France'],
  ],
});
```

### parameters for `OpenPassport1StepVerifier`

| Parameter       | Optional | Description                                                                       |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scope`         | No       | The scope of your application, is unique for each application.                    |

```

# Development

```bash
yarn install-sdk
```

## Tests

To run the tests, you need to download the circuits and the zkey files from the AWS s3 bucket.
This script will also compile the circuits to generate the wasm files.
Make sure that the circuits in the circuits folder are up to date with the AWS zkey files.

```bash
yarn download-circuits
```

Then run the tests with the following command:

```bash
yarn test
```
